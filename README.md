## What even is this?
A little tool written in python to watch and download anime from the terminal (the better way to watch anime).
This project's main aim is to create an enjoyable experience watching and downloading anime, directly from the terminal - your favorite place.

**Features include: Seaonals mode, AniList and MyAnimeList integration, custom post-download scripts, automatic remuxing, discord presence and many more! You can even use your own files instead of online anime sites!**

Since the version 3 rewrite this project is split into api and frontend. This makes it easy to integrate anipy-cli into your own project!

As one wise man once said:
> I DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE FUCKING CODE! i just want to download this stupid fucking application and use it.
>
> WHY IS THERE CODE??? MAKE A FUCKING .EXE FILE AND GIVE IT TO ME. these dumbfucks think that everyone is a developer and understands code. well i am not and i don't understand it. I only know to download and install applications. SO WHY THE FUCK IS THERE CODE? make an EXE file and give it to me. STUPID FUCKING SMELLY NERDS

<sub>Please do not take this seriously this is some stupid copypasta</sub>

We do not have an .exe, but we have pipx: `pipx install anipy-cli`
