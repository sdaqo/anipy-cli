# Getting started with the CLI

## Installation

### Pre-requesits
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.9 higher, this is not tested ;) but I think that this is the case). If you are on windows avoid the python from the Microsoft Store and use the official one linked.
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
- [Pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) (optional, but very much recommended, I mean it, get this)
- [mpv](https://mpv.io/) or any other player listed [here](../availabilty.md/#current-version), but I strongly recommended mpv or a derivative because it **✨ just works ✨**.
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) (optional, but again, I recommend it because without it you can not use some features)

### Options to install
- **Recommended: Via pipx**
    ```
    # Install

## Usage

=== "Explainations for non-obvious stuff"

    ### Seasonal Mode
    Seasonal Mode is one of the major modes of anipy-cli, with it you can
    manage your weekly dose of anime. Every new anime season you can add your
    anime you want to watch and check back every week to see if there are any new episodes!

    !!! info
        All major modes are listed under `Actions` in `anipy-cli --help`, you can only pick one of them.

    #### Check out the main menu of seasonal mode:
    ```
    [a] Add Anime
    [e] Delete one anime from seasonals
    [l] List anime in seasonals
    [c] Change dub/sub of anime in seasonals
    [d] Download newest episodes
    [w] Binge watch newest episodes
    [q] Quit
    Enter option:
    ```
    All these options should be pretty self-explanatory.

    ### MyAnimeList/AniList Mode
    The two tracker Modes are major modes of anipy-cli. The modes is similar to the seasonal
    mode but it uses your online anime tracker list instead.

    #### Where do I put my login?
    There are several options:

    - Always login through the cli prompt.
    - Set username and password in the [config](#config) for MyAnimeList
    - Set anilist token in [config](#config) as `anilist_token` for AnList, this can be obtained when logging in via the cli for the first time.
    - Set the username in the config and pass the password via the `--mal-password` option. (only MyAnimeList)

    #### Anime Tagging in Trackers
    You can tag (either via the cli using the `t` option or directly in the tracker itself) your anime with a dub and a ignore tag.
    You can define the name of those tags in the config, the defaults are `dub` and `ignore`.

    **dub**
    : This tag makes the anime play/download in dub within the tracker modes.

    **ignore**
    : With this tag the anime will be completely ignored by the tracker modes.

    #### Check out the main menu of MAL mode. (AniList mode is basically identical)
    ```
    [a] Add Anime
    [e] Delete one anime from MyAnimeList
    [l] List anime in MyAnimeList
    [t] Tag anime in MyAnimeList (dub/ignore)
    [m] Map MyAnimeList anime to providers
    [s] Sync MyAnimeList into seasonals
    [b] Sync seasonals into MyAnimeList
    [d] Download newest episodes
    [x] Download all episodes
    [w] Binge watch newest episodes
    [q] Quit
    Enter option:
    ```

    !!! note
        This explanation applies to AniList and MyAnimeList

    The `m` option is **very important** it syncs the MyAnimeList anime to provider animeso we can actually get videos
    for the anime. You will be prompted for this anyway so do not worry to much, but it helps to run this every once in a while.

    The `s` option syncs all the anime in the status catagories specified in the config as `mal_status_catagories` to the
    seasonls, including episodes left of etc.

    The `b` option is the same as `s` but in the other direction.

    The `x` downloads **all** of the episodes instead of only the non-watched ones. This is pretty nice
    if you want to sync all the anime to your local disk, just run it once in a while (maybe even with [Auto Update](#auto-update)) to
    keep everything in-sync, it will skip already downloaded ones.

    ### Auto Update
    Auto update is a flag in anipy-cli: `--auto-update` it will automatically update and download all anime in seasonals or mal mode from start
    episode to newest. This is increadibly handy if you want to set up some [cron job](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to keep your library up-to-date.

    !!! note
        This only works in combination with `-M` or `-S`

    Here is a example for a cron job:
    ```
    # Cronjob runs every 2 minutes and checks whether anipy-cli is still running or not
    # (only run the job if last one is finished)

    */2 *   * * *   username        pidof -x anipy-cli || anipy-cli -Ma >> /var/log/anipy-cli.log
    ```

    ### Other weird options
    `--mal-sync-to-seasonals` / `--anilist-sync-to-seasonals`
    : This options just automatically executes the `s` option in the MAL mode menu. Useful for automation.

    `--ffmpeg`
    : This makes the downloader default the [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (except for .mp4 files), ffmpeg must be [installed](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

    ### Native Provider
    The native provider uses a directory on your filesystem to build an anime database that can be used in the cli. To use it, set your provider to `native` and set the provider url for the native provider to your anime directory! The implementation is very basic. Your folder structure is not really important, both a flat directory and a directory with season subdirectories works. What is important, is that, your files should sort properly, episodes numbers are assigned based on the alphabetical order of files in a directory.

=== "Help Output"

    This is just a paste from `anipy-cli --help`.
    ```
    usage: anipy-cli [-D | -B | -H | -S | -M | -A | --delete-history | --migrate-history] [-s SEARCH] [-ss [SEASONAL_SEARCH]]
